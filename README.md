<h2>Abstract</h2>
The project is intended to help integrating mathematical
expressions in python with greater ease and provide powerful
tools along them.
Python's syntax can be cumbersome when it comes to 
more sophisticated mathematical notations, so wouldn't it be easier to
use them in a more intuitive "math-like" syntax?
